    <h2>The Space Unconference</h2>
    <p>SpaceUp Barcelona is a two-days space unconference, where participants decide the topics, schedule, and structure of the event. Everyone who attends SpaceUp is encouraged to give a talk, moderate a panel, or start a discussion. Sessions are proposed and scheduled on the day they’re given, which means the usual <i>hallway conversations</i> turn into full-fledged topics.</p>

    <h3>The basics</h3>
    <img class="thumbnail" src="images/basics.jpg">
    <p>SpaceUp is an unconference, also known as a user-generated conference or a BarCamp. There are no spectators at SpaceUp, only participants. All attendees are expected to give a demo, present a talk, or participate in a panel or roundtable. <a href="http://spaceup.org/agenda/">Learn at the SpaceUp site more about how it works</a></p>

    <h3>T minus 5 Talks</h3>
    <img class="thumbnail" src="images/talks.jpg">
    <p>One of the most exciting parts of SpaceUp is T minus 5, a series of short talks in the <a href="http://www.ignitetalks.io/">Ignite format</a>. Each speaker gets 5 minutes to talk, with 20 slides that rotate automatically every 15 seconds. It’s a fun format that’s more like karaoke than giving a presentation; it’s tough to keep up with your slides, but the friendly crowd cheers you on.</p>
