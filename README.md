# SpaceUp Barcelona Website

SpaceUp Barcelona is a two-days space unconference, where participants decide the topics, schedule, and structure of the event. 
Everyone who attends SpaceUp is encouraged to give a talk, moderate a panel, or start a discussion.

This is the code for the static website of the event. It can be used as a template for other SpaceUp meetings easily 
modifying logo and texts. It is mounted as a rack application (master branch), or as a pure static site in 
the gh-pages branch, so it can be deployed automatically to heroku or as a github pages site.
