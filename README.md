# SpaceUp Barcelona Website

[SpaceUp Barcelona](http://www.spaceupbcn.org) is a two-days space unconference, where participants decide the topics, schedule, and structure of the event.
Everyone who attends SpaceUp is encouraged to give a talk, moderate a panel, or start a discussion.

This is the code for the static website of the event. It can be used as a template for other SpaceUp meetings easily
modifying logo and texts. It is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and mounted as a rack application so it can be deployed automatically to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) (use the [jekyll buildpack](https://github.com/andycroll/heroku-buildpack-jekyll)) or as a [github pages site](https://pages.github.com/) (put your code in a `gh-pages` branch).
